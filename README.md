# haxlike

A Java experiment for declarative data fetching, akin to [haxl][].

## Declarative Data Fetching

To understand what haxlike does, consider the following code:

```java
var users = fetchUsers()
  .traverse(user -> {
    var posts = fetchPosts(user.getId());
    return new UserWithPosts(user, posts);
  });
```

This is a na√Øve implementation of attaching a one-to-many relation (posts) to
an entity (users). If these were imperative calls, you'd perform one query to get all
users, then one additonal query for _each and every_ user to get their posts. This
is the so-called _N+1 query problem_ and can get you in terrible trouble.

With haxlike you can write exactly the above piece of code. You'll need one more
line to actually trigger the data fetching, but behind the scenes the engine will
take care of:

- **Batching:** Run queries for group of similar entities instead of one by one.
- **Deduplication:** Don't include the same entity multiple times in a query.
- **Caching**: Don't fetch an entity more than once.

On top of that, haxlike provides a functional style based on immutable data
structures, with useful traversal and manipulation functions for the most
common use cases.
