# haxlike

A Java experiment for declarative data fetching, akin to [haxl][].

## Declarative Data Fetching

To understand what haxlike does, consider the following code:

```java
var users = fetchUsers()
    .traverse(user -> {
        var posts = fetchPosts(user.getId());
        return new UserWithPosts(user, posts);
    });
```

This is a naÃ¯ve implementation of attaching a one-to-many relation (posts) to
an entity (users). If these were imperative calls, you'd perform one query to get all
users, then one additonal query for _each and every_ user to get their posts. This
is the so-called _N+1 query problem_ and can get you in terrible trouble.

With haxlike you can basically write the above piece of code in good conscience:

```java
var users = fetchUsers()
    .flatMapEach(user -> {
        var posts = fetchPosts(user.getId());
        return posts.map(values -> new UserWithPosts(user, values));
    });
engine.resolve(users);
```

You need one more line to actually trigger the data fetching but behind the scenes
the engine will take care of:

- **Batching:** Run queries for group of similar entities instead of one by one.
- **Parallelism:**: Run independent queries in parallel instead of sequentially.
- **Deduplication:** Don't include the same entity multiple times in a query.
- **Caching**: Don't fetch an entity more than once.

On top of that, haxlike provides a functional style based on immutable data
structures, with useful traversal and manipulation functions for the most
common use cases. For example, the above could also have been written as:

```java
var users = fetchUsers()
    .attachEach(
        UserWithPosts::new,
        user -> fetchPosts(user.getId())
    );
```
